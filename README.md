Generic IoT Platform
===================

The project aims at providing an open source web and mobile platform for all IoT based data analysis. The platform allows users to send data to the platform for real time data visualisation. Users can also control the devices through the platform. Power consumption of every device can also be viewed through this platform.



Real-time Data Streaming:
-------------------------

 - The user can view the current reading of the sensors through the gauge chart.
 -  Time vs Value data of the device is plotted through line chart in real time.
 -  The user can see day-to-day analysis of the device readings through a line chart.


Controlling of the Device:
--------------------------

 - The user can turn ON/OFF the device through a toggle switch.
 - The user can schedule a timer for turning ON/OFF the device depending upon his requirements.
 - The user can also change the intensity of the device through intensity slider.

Energy Consumption:
-------------------

 - The user can view the energy consumed by the device in a day Project Creation. 
 - The user can also create Projects and aggregate different devices together that have similar functionalities associated with the project.
